# Enigma
I recently started working on some projects about cryptography. This is my first program, a replica on the Nazi machine Enigma, from WWII. It has got 3 rotors and a reflector.
I'm open to suggestions on improvements. It seems to work fine but I can see some flaws in the program.
You're obviously free to use this program for wathever you like!
